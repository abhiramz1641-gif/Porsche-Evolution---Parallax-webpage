            <p>The 901 concept of 1963 heralded the start of a production run even Porsche probably didn’t expect to
                reach – and no doubt surpass – six decades. Trivia fans can rejoice at the fact the name changed form
                901 to 911 to avoid potential fisticuffs with Peugeot.It was designed as a larger, more practical
                version of the 356 with an extra pair of seats. As such, critics were quick to pounce on its lack of
                focus.Early 911s used two-litre engines with as little as 130bhp, though they also weighed bang on a
                tonne. Both engine sizes and power outputs swelled over the next decade, culminating in perhaps the most
                coveted of all early 911s, the 210bhp 2.7 Carrera RS.</p>

                generation.

                The G-Series ran for a long time, too, debuting in 1973 and only being replaced in 1989. The most
                significant move made in this time was the introduction of turbocharging to the 911, the Turbo you see
                above arriving in 1975 with a mighty 260bhp powering the rear wheels. Back then, though, turbochargers
                were saved for only the fastest 911s...</p>

            <p>The 964, to give it its internal codename, arrived at the very end of the 1980s, bringing with it some
                mildly updated styling but a whole heap of new tech.

                In fact, it was 85 per cent new. Four-wheel drive arrived for the first time, as did other tech goodies
                like power steering, ABS brakes and airbags.

                Until recently, second-hand examples of these could be picked up exceedingly cheap, its design viewed
                retrospectively as the least attractive in 911 history. Many are now becoming donor cars for Singer
                products, though, while the stripped-out 964 RS is spiralling in value in recognition of it being one of
                the focused 911 products ever.</p>

                Ferdinand was an Austrian-German engineer who founded the Porsche company in 1931. Porsche is a family
                name of French origin, meaning “forge worker.”</p>

                regarded by many Porsche die-hards as the prettiest and best-judged of the lot.

                It was the last 911 with an air-cooled engine, while it also introduced perhaps the lairiest car in 911
                history to drive, the GT2. It’s a badge that’s continued service since, of course, but the original
                perhaps best displayed those tail-happy tendencies brought about by the 911’s infamously unconventional
                rear-engine layout. Small wonder it earned itself the nickname ‘Widow Maker’.</p>

            <p>Following such a loved generation of car, the 1998 arrival of the water-cooled 996 was met with grumbles

                implacable Porsche aficionados they’ve tried to please.

                Those nonplussed by the change in hardware were probably upset by the looks, the 911 gaining its first
                major styling change, not dissimilar to the cheaper Boxster and notable for its – shock horror! –
                non-elliptical headlights.

                The 996 also marked the exponential growth in 911 variants, but when that also goes hand-in-hand with
                the first ever GT3 being launched, that’s far from bad news.</p>

            <p>Water-cooled 911s also kicked off the habit of major mid-life updates. The 996 received its big facelift

                Targa variant, though it was nothing like as stylish as its ancestors.

                The mk2 996 also marked the arrival of another 911 GT2, and while it was a bit less hairy than its
                Nineties namesake, it was still a 196mph, turbocharged 911 without the safety of a four-wheel-drive

                GT2 entered unchartered territory with 530bhp.

                Once again, though, claims of diminishing of character greeted the 997's arrival, with purists grumbling
                about less feelsome steering and the softening of the 911's, um, exciting edges thanks to stronger grip.

            <p>The looks barely changed, but there were bigger changes afoot underneath them for the updated 997. More
                efficient direct injection engines marked the first nod to more environmentally caring 911s, while the
                PDK twin-clutch gearbox arrived. Immediate response wasn’t rapturous, but after Porsche fitted the
                double-clutcher with proper paddles, its appeal over the clunky old Tiptronic automatic was clear.

                The 911 reached its only recently unsurpassed power peak thanks to the utterly ludicrous 611bhp GT2 RS,
                while arguably the best ever 911 – the GT3 RS 4.0 – also landed in this generation, too. No wonder its

                Still, there’s been plenty to distract from that, with an amazingly new round-edged GT car character in
                the regular Carrera models, and a new level of savagery with the bonkers GT3 RS. The Targa is also cool
                again.

                It will go down in history as the last of the 911s to have naturally aspirated Carreras that rev to the

                It’s a move that initially upset the purists, but then so was electric steering, PDK, water-cooling, and
                so much more. And the 991.2 enjoyed some rather big moments: the one millionth Porsche 911, the arrival
